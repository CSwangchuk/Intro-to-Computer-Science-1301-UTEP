Intro to Computer Science – CS1301 (UTEP)

This repository contains all programming labs, assignments, and practice problems completed for CS 1301 – Intro to Computer Science at The University of Texas at El Paso.
The projects demonstrate foundational skills in Java, including problem-solving, algorithms, and object-oriented programming.

📘 Course Overview

CS1301 introduces fundamental programming concepts using Java. Throughout the semester, I built several labs and small projects focused on:

Variables, input/output, data types

Conditionals and logical decision-making

Loops (for/while)

Arrays and basic searching

Methods and modular programming

Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Multi-class programs

Menu-driven applications

Basic software design and testing

🧪 Comprehensive Labs Summary
✔ CL1 – Java Basics & Problem Solving

Practiced input/output with Scanner

Performed calculations using variables and operators

Focused on formatting, user prompts, and simple logic

Built confidence in writing and running first Java programs

✔ CL2 – Pokémon Region Simulator (OOP Project)

An object-oriented mini-application modeled after a simplified Pokémon world.

Key Features:

Multiple interacting classes: Pokemon, Trainer, Region

Encapsulation of attributes like name, type, health, and attack power

Use of arrays to store teams and Pokédex data

Randomized events (battles, damage calculation)

Menu-driven user interface

Demonstrated understanding of OOP, constructors, and methods
