## 📘 Course Overview
CS1301 introduces fundamental programming concepts using Java. Throughout the semester, I built several labs and small projects focused on:

- Variables, input/output, data types  
- Conditionals and logical decision-making  
- Loops (for/while)  
- Arrays and basic searching  
- Methods and modular programming  
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Multi-class programs  
- Menu-driven applications  
- Basic software design and testing

## 🧪 Comprehensive Labs Summary

### ✔ CL1 – Java Basics & Problem Solving
- Practiced input/output with `Scanner`  
- Performed calculations using variables and operators  
- Focused on formatting, user prompts, and simple logic  
- Built confidence in writing and running first Java programs

### ✔ CL2 – Pokémon Region Simulator (OOP Project)
An object-oriented mini-application modeled after a simplified Pokémon world.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple interacting classes: `Pokemon`, `Trainer`, `Region`  
- Encapsulation of attributes like name, type, health, and attack power  
- Use of arrays to store teams and Pokédex data  
- Randomized events (battles, damage calculation)  
- Menu-driven user interface  
- Demonstrated understanding of OOP, constructors, and methods
